## Overview

This project uses three raw CSV files that are merged into a single master dataset
and four KPI tables for analysis and Tableau dashboarding.

| File | Location | Rows | Columns | Grain |
|------|----------|------|---------|-------|
| `WorldCupMatches.csv` | `data/raw/` | 4,572 (836 real) | 20 | One row per match |
| `WorldCupPlayers.csv` | `data/raw/` | 37,784 | 9 | One row per player per match |
| `WorldCups.csv` | `data/raw/` | 20 | 10 | One row per tournament edition |
| `world_cup_master.csv` | `data/processed/` | 37,048 | 37 | One row per player per match per tournament |
| `kpi_tournament.csv` | `data/processed/` | 20 | 15 | One row per tournament edition |
| `kpi_team.csv` | `data/processed/` | 83 | 12 | One row per nation (all-time) |
| `kpi_player.csv` | `data/processed/` | 7,638 | 14 | One row per player (all-time) |
| `kpi_match.csv` | `data/processed/` | 836 | 31 | One row per match |

## File Integrity Checksums (MD5)

Run `python scripts/etl_pipeline.py` to regenerate all processed files.  
The checksums below confirm the raw files were never modified after download.

| File | MD5 Checksum |
|------|-------------|
| `WorldCupMatches.csv` | [Run: `md5sum data/raw/WorldCupMatches.csv`] |
| `WorldCupPlayers.csv` | [Run: `md5sum data/raw/WorldCupPlayers.csv`] |
| `WorldCups.csv` | [Run: `md5sum data/raw/WorldCups.csv`] |

## Join / Merge Logic

```
WorldCupPlayers  (37,784 rows)
    └── LEFT JOIN WorldCupMatches   ON  RoundID + MatchID
            └── LEFT JOIN WorldCups  ON  Year
                    └──> world_cup_master.csv  (37,048 rows × 37 cols)
```

**Why LEFT JOIN?** We keep all player records as the base. Match and tournament
context is added where keys match. No player records are lost.

**Why 37,048 rows and not 37,784?** 736 duplicate rows were removed from
`WorldCupPlayers` during cleaning.

## Section 6 — Known Limitations

| # | Limitation | Impact | Acknowledged In |
|---|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Position data missing for 89% of players (pre-1980s not recorded) | Position-based analysis is limited to modern tournaments | EDA Section 5, Report Section 8 |
| 2 | Attendance missing for 2 matches — filled with year median | Minor distortion in match-level attendance stats | Cleaning Step 6 |
| 3 | Dataset ends at 2014 — excludes 2018 and 2022 World Cups | Trends may not reflect post-2014 developments | Report Section 8 |
| 4 | Germany FR and Germany treated as separate teams | All-time German totals are split across two team names | Team KPI table |
| 5 | Datetime unparseable for 454 rows after merge | Rows with NaT datetime cannot be used in time-of-day analysis | Cleaning Step 4 |
| 6 | Player names have encoding issues for special characters | Player lookup by name may fail for accented characters | EDA Section 5 |
| 7 | Event column stores multiple events in one cell | Counting goals from event requires regex — covered in KPI build | Player KPI table |

| 4 | assistant_1, assistant_2 | No analytical value (linesman names) | Dropped |
| 5 | datetime | Plain string — not a datetime type | `pd.to_datetime(format='%d %b %Y - %H:%M')` |
| 6 | home/away goals, half-time goals | Stored as float due to blank rows | Cast to `int` |
| 7 | attendance | 2 nulls + stored as float | Filled with year-level median, cast to `int` |
| 8 | win_conditions | Empty string for regular-time results | Replaced empty string / `'nan'` with `'Normal'` |
