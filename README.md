## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. **Extraction Phase**
- **Input:** 3 raw CSV files (WorldCups, WorldCupMatches, WorldCupPlayers)
- **Records Loaded:** 37,784 players, 4,572 match entries, 20 tournaments
- **Output:** Raw dataframes ready for cleaning

### 2. **Cleaning Phase**
- **Empty Rows Removed:** 3,720 rows (82% of matches data)
- **Duplicate Matches Removed:** 16 duplicate MatchIDs
- **Data Fixes Applied:**
  - Standardized team names (Germany FR → West Germany, Korea Republic → South Korea)
  - Fixed HTML-encoded names (rn">Bosnia and Herzegovina)
  - Parsed European dot-format attendance (1.045.246 → 1,045,246)
  - Extracted goals, yellow cards, and red cards from Event field using regex
  - Normalized match stages (Group 1, Group A → Group Stage)
  - Imputed 2 missing attendance values with yearly median

### 3. **Transformation Phase**
- **Derived Columns Created:**
  - `Match_Result`: Home Win / Away Win / Draw
  - `Total_Goals`: Sum of home and away goals
  - `Goals_Scored`: Extracted from player Event string
  - `Yellow_Cards`, `Red_Cards`: Parsed from Event field
  - `Lineup`: Mapped S→Starter, N→Substitute
  - `Win_Conditions`: Normal / AET / Penalties

### 4. **Merge Phase**
- **Step 1:** Players ← Matches (many-to-one: 37,784 player records per match)
- **Step 2:** Result ← Tournaments (join on Year for Host_Nation context)
- **Final Dataset:** `wc_schedule_analysis.csv` (37,784 rows × 15 columns)

### 5. **Validation Phase**
- **Null Values:** 0 (100% complete dataset)
- **Data Consistency:** 100% (all 37,784 records pass validation)
- **Duplicate Records:** 31,745 (expected—multiple players per match)
- **Data Types:** All correctly typed (int64, str)

## Key Insights Summary

See reports/project_report.pdf for full analysis. Dashboard: see tableau/dashboard_links.md.

Current analysis takeaways:
- The dataset is clean and ready for analysis with 37,784 rows and no nulls.
- Attendance has grown strongly over time, from 590,549 in 1930 to 3,386,810 in 2014.
- Average attendance per match increased from about 32.8k in 1930 to about 52.9k in 2014.
- There are 83 teams, 151 venues, and 20 tournaments in scope.
- The merged dataset is player-level, so match outcome counts should be interpreted carefully and validated again at unique-match level before final conclusions.
- The most important next work is EDA, statistical testing, KPI export, dashboard creation, and report writing.
